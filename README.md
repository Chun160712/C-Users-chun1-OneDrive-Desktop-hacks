The SMART studying website is made to help students motivate themselves in order to succeed in school as well as to guide them to set up SMART goals (long term goals) through the SMART GOALS page.
Users will then be encouraged to break it down to daily tasks and add them onto the DAILY TASKS page to keep them on track, as well as self-reflect through the self-rating system on the same page.
At any time, users can access and review their goals through the OVERALL RATING page and also check their overall rating.
